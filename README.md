## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures such as `x86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list) and our announcement [here](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/02/21/the-lsio-pipeline-project/). 

Simply pulling `linuxserver/tvheadend` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| x86-64 | amd64-latest |
| arm64 | arm64v8-latest |
| armhf | arm32v7-latest |

## Version Tags

This image provides various versions that are available via tags. `latest` tag usually provides the latest stable version. Others are considered under development and caution must be exercised when using them.

| Tag | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| latest | Current latest release. |
| release-4.2 | Latest release from 4.2 branch. |
| stable-4.2.1 | Old stable version. Will not be updated anymore! |
| stable-4.0.9 | Old stable version. Will not be updated anymore! |

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker

```
docker create \
  --name=tvheadend \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -e RUN_OPTS=<run options here> `#optional` \
  -p 9981:9981 \
  -p 9982:9982 \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  -v <path to recordings>:/recordings \
  --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri `#optional` \
  --device /dev/drb:/dev/dvb `#optional` \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  linuxserver/tvheadend
```

#### Host vs. Bridge

If you use IPTV, SAT>IP or HDHomeRun, you need to create the container with --net=host and remove the -p flags. This is because of a limitation in docker and multicast.


### docker-compose

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```
---
version: "2"
services:
  tvheadend:
    image: linuxserver/tvheadend
    container_name: tvheadend
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - RUN_OPTS=<run options here> #optional
    volumes:
      - <path to data>:/config
      - <path to recordings>:/recordings
    ports:
      - 9981:9981
      - 9982:9982
    devices:
      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri #optional
      - /dev/drb:/dev/dvb #optional
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 9981` | WebUI |
| `-p 9982` | HTSP server port. |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. |
| `-e RUN_OPTS=<run options here>` | Optionally specify additional arguments to be passed. See Additional runtime parameters. |
| `-v /config` | Where TVHeadend show store it's config files. |
| `-v /recordings` | Where you want the PVR to store recordings. |
| `--device /dev/dri` | Only needed if you want to use your AMD/Intel GPU for hardware accelerated video encoding (vaapi). |
| `--device /dev/dvb` | Only needed if you want to pass through a DVB card to the container. If you use IPTV or HDHomeRun you can leave it out. |

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Application Setup

The setup depends if you run the one of the stable tags or use latest. Running latest is the easiest as it has a setup wizard.

**Stable**

First thing to do is to go to Configuration --> DVB Inputs --> TV adapters and add your LNB/switch info. Then create a new network in the Networks tab and set the correct pre-defined muxes and orbital position.
Go back to the TV adapters tab and add the newly created network under universal LNB. Go back to the Networks tab and mark the network you created earlier and press the Force Scan button. Tvheadend will now scan the muxes for services.

After the scan is done, head to the Services tab and find the services you want as channels, mark them, and press map services. They should now appear under Configuration --> Channel/EPG.

**Latest**

The first thing to do is to run the setup wizard. If it doesn't pop up at first login, you can find it in Configuration --> General --> Base and click Start Wizard. This will guide you to set up the basic parts of tvheadend.

**Configuring XMLTV grabber**

To configure the XMLTV grabber, first check if your grabber is listed in Configuration --> Channel/EPG --> EPG Grabber Modules. If it's listed, you will have to configure the grabber before enabling.
Find the path in the path field of your grabber. We will use the last part. It starts with tv_grab_. Add it after /usr/bin/ in the below command. There should be no space between Usr/bin/ and the part you added.

```
docker exec -it -u abc tvheadend /usr/bin/for_you_to_fill_out --configure
```

Now follow the onscreen progress. If you get asked about cache, just accept the default. After you have configured your grabber, you can go back and enable your grabber.

If you allready have a configuration file, you can add it in the .xmltv folder where you mapped the /config volume. If it's not created, create it.

**Comskip**
This container comes with Comskip for commercial flagging of recordings. This you have to add in the recording config of tvheadend.
Go to Configuration --> Recording. Change the view level to advanced in the top right corner, and add the below in the Post-processor command field.

```
/usr/bin/comskip --ini=/config/comskip/comskip.ini "%f"
```

Now comskip will run after each recording is finished. You will find comskip.ini in the comskip folder of your /config volume mapping. See the [Comskip](http://www.kaashoek.com/comskip/) homepage for tuning of the ini file.


**FFmpeg**

FFmpeg is installed in /usr/bin/ in case you need to use it with pipe.

**EPG XML file**

If you have EPG data in XML format from a supplier, you can drop it in the data folder of your /config volume mapping. If it doesn't exist, create it. Then choose the XML file grabber in Configuration --> Channel/EPG --> EPG Grabber Modules.
If you use WebGrab+Plus, choose the WebGrab+Plus XML file grabber. The XML file goes in the same path as above.
The xml file has to be named guide.xml.

For advanced setup of tvheadend, go to [Tvheadend][appurl]

**Picons**

We have added all the picons from [picons.xyz](https://picons.xyz/) in the folder /picons. To enable the use of these picons, add the path to the Channel icon path in Configuration --> General --> Base.
You need to enable minimum advanced view level to see the picons options.

## Additional runtime parameters

In some cases it might be necessary to start tvheadend with additional parameters, for example to enable debugging or specify webroot for reverse proxy. Be sure to have the right parameters set, as adding the wrong once might lead to the container not starting correctly.



## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it tvheadend /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f tvheadend`
* container version number 
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' tvheadend`
* image version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' linuxserver/tvheadend`

## Updating Info

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. With some exceptions (ie. nextcloud, plex), we do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section above to see if it is recommended for the image.  
  
Below are the instructions for updating containers:  
  
### Via Docker Run/Create
* Update the image: `docker pull linuxserver/tvheadend`
* Stop the running container: `docker stop tvheadend`
* Delete the container: `docker rm tvheadend`
* Recreate a new container with the same docker create parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* Start the new container: `docker start tvheadend`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Taisun auto-updater (especially useful if you don't remember the original parameters)
* Pull the latest image at its tag and replace it with the same env variables in one shot:
  ```
  docker run --rm \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock taisun/updater \
  --oneshot tvheadend
  ```
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Docker Compose
* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull tvheadend`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d tvheadend`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`
